##### Communication protocol for Group
Primary communication through the group project slack channel as well as updating our group GitHub respository branch promptly.
Zoom group sessions can be planned when schedules allow typically weekends after 8pm. Group will update and keep communication on scheduling open through the primary 
slack channel.


### Project Overview
For this final project we have chosen to use the skills learned in scraping websites, cleaning data, creating ERD and databases, and being able to present a cohesive 
story with visualizations. The data we will be working with is a list of movies released from 2010-2016 from the website IMDB with their movie rating and comparing to 
a fan fiction site AO3. This website collects tags for each movie name when there is a story added pertaining to the movie title. We will be trying to determine if 
there is a correlation between the popular movies releases and number of fan fiction stories.




##### Deliverable:
Segment 1 2/9 
1. Source data chosen (website pulled from AO3 and IMBD dataset)
2. Read sample data into Postgres with SQL 
3. Outline machine learning model 
4. README



#### Presentation
The reason for selecting this topic is to create a machine learning model to help determine if movie popularity releases affect the number of fan fiction stories on 
this subject.By using a dataset from IMBD with a list of movies based on popularity, or high IMDB score, from 2010-2016 and the dataset scraped from the website A03 
that includes each movie titles and containing the total number of stories uploaded to the site with this title tagged. 
We will be using our skills across the board with website scraping, cleaning data using Pandas, SQL and Postgres, creating a machine learning model, and being able to 
present our findings as if to a potential client.
